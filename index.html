<h1>A Brief Introduction</h1>

<p>Hey there!  My name is Jon Haring and I am an aspiring computer programmer.</p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/CN8vqSo.png" title="FIRE!" height = 200px align = "left"/>
In that endeavor one of the things I have to do is create a web page that tells
a story.  It has to be formatted in HTML and CSS.  It also needs a picture like
this one.
This picture is an illustration of what I had to constantly report on and see in
my previous career. While car accidents are cool, after seeing so many and learning
what horrible things happen on the roadways, I decided to find a new career.
So lets get to the story.

<h2>The Journey Begins</h2>

I started my quest to become a prgrammer by learning to program using the Python
progaming language at a program run by <a href ="http://www.launchcode.org">Launchcode</a>.
 It was pretty tough but I perservered and came out on the other side with a
 great new skill.  I am excited to continue learing how what I
 have alreay learned can be applied in a real world context.
<h3>Something Old, Something New</h3>

 Now in my class we are learning HTML and CSS. I have some experience in this. I
  have already coded my own <a href ="http://www.jonharing.com">website</a>. I can
  hopefully apply some of the knowledge I gained doing that in this class and build
  upon those skills.
