<h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>
<main>
   <p>Hey there!  My name is Jon Haring and I am an aspiring computer programmer.</p>
<img id = "fire" src="http://i.imgur.com/CN8vqSo.png"/>
In that endeavor one of the things I have to do is create a web page that tells
a story.  It has to be formatted in HTML and CSS.  It also needs a picture like
this one.
This picture is an illustration of what I had to constantly report on and see in
my previous career. While car accidents are cool, after seeing so many and learning
what horrible things happen on the roadways, I decided to find a new career.
So lets get to the story.
</main>

<h2>The Journey Begins</h2>

I started my quest to become a prgrammer by learning to program using the Python
progaming language at a program run by <a href ="http://www.launchcode.org">Launchcode</a>.
 It was pretty tough but I perservered and came out on the other side with a
 great new skill.  I am excited to continue learing how what I
 have alreay learned can be applied in a real world context.
<h3>Something Old, Something New</h3>
<img id= "ASK" src ="http://adaptiveskate.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/A.S.K_white-circle.jpg"  height="200px">
 <p class = "tex"> Now in my class we are learning HTML and CSS. I have some experience in this. I
  have already coded my own <a href ="http://www.jonharing.com">website</a>. I can
  hopefully apply some of the knowledge I gained doing that in this class and build
  upon those skills.  I also work as the web designer and social media coordinator
  for a non-profit organization.  It is called the <a href ="http://www.adaptiveskate.org">The
Adaptive Skate Kollective</a>  It has even been featured in <a href ="http://skateboarding.transworld.net/news/hope-skates-eternal/#jycejYWF3WWw46UQ.97">Transworld Skateboarding
Magazine</a>.</p> <article>
    The <strong>Adaptive Skate Kollective</strong>, a nonprofit organization,
is dedicated to raising awareness for the adaptive community. They will soon be
offering skateboarding training, coaching, competitions and hosting special events
 for youth, adults and veterans living with physical disabilities. Their goal is
 to open a training facility in the Kansas City area and create skateboarding
 programs for skateboarders, especially those who are adaptive, as well as
  offering after school programs.</article>
  <h2> Now I am done and ready for what's next</h2>
  <p class = "tex">So now that I have completed this assignment I am ready to post it
      and move on to the next assignment.  It has been <em>fun</em>relearning how
      code and design some text on a web page. I hope to get a good completed grade
      on this assigment and be on my way to becoming a bad ass web developer.</p>
